      Bug#15985893: GTID SKIPPED EVENTS ON MASTER CAUSE SEMI SYNC TIME-OUTS
      
      hen using GTIDs and semi sync, whenever a transaction is
      executed on the master but is not sent to the slave because it
      already has this id, semi sync will time out.  In fact, semi sync
      hooks will still trigger a waiting process in the master, but as
      the transaction never reaches the slave, a reply is never sent.
      
      Making the semi sync plug-in call the reportReplyBinlog method
      whenever a transaction is skipped solves this issue.
      
      @semisync_master.cc
        A new method skipSlaveReply was created  to allow
        the interruption of the waiting process without a reply.
      @semisync_master.h
        New method header and other headers updated
      @semisync_master_plugin.cc
        The after send event response now depends on the transaction being 
        skipped or not
      @replication.h rpl_handler.h rpl_handler.cc
        The after_send_event hook now takes new parameters that flag if the
        event was skipped, what was is position and binlog. 
      @rpl_master.cc
        The after_send_event hook is now always invoked taking as new
        parameters the position and binlog when transactions are skipped.

  Bug#14774779 CRASH RECOVERY FAILED, UNABLE TO COMPRESS A PAGE
  
  rb://1721
  approved by: Marko Makela
  
  The bug was introduced by WL6344 in the innodb_log_compressed_pages
  part. If we don't log compressed pages then we need to do compression
  during recovery which requires that the uncompressed pages must be
  deterministically same during recovery but they can differ in garbage
  bytes potentially causing compression during recovery to fail. This
  bug will manifest itself only when recovery is done in multiple batches
  of redo apply.
  
  This workaround is to take away innodb_log_compressed_pages option.
  Note it is not a full revert of WL6344

  But ALGORITHM = COPY will do such conversion with only
  a warning (which in case of strict sql_mode it will turn the

  So to be consistent, we will only allow INPLACE for
  NULL -> NOT NULL under strict sql_mode, since that will give

  If not strict mode ha_innodbase::check_if_supported_inplace_alter

  Also notice that ADD PRIMARY KEY () will implicitly add NOT NULL if

          bug#11761752: DO NOT ALLOW USE OF ALTERNATE DATA STREAMS ON NTFS FILESYSTEM.
          
          File names with colon are being disallowed because of the Alternate Data 
          Stream (ADS) feature of NTFS that could be misused. ADS allows data to be 
          written to alternate streams of a normal file. The data in alternate 
          streams cannot be seen by normal tools on Windows (explorer, cmd.exe). As 
          a result someone can use this feature to hide large amount of data in 
          alternate streams and admins will have no easy way of figuring out the 
          files that are using that disk space. The fix also disallows ADS in the 
          scenarios where file name is passed as some dynamic variable.
          
          An important thing about the fix is that it DOES NOT disallow ADS file 
          names if they are not dynamic (i.e. if the file is created by using some 
          option that needs local access to the MySQL server, for example error log
          file). The reasoning is that if some MySQL option related to files 
          requires access to the local machine (it is not dynamic), then user can very 
          well create data in ADS by some other means. This fixes only those scenarios 
          which can allow users to create data in ADS over the wire.
          
          File names with colon are being disallowed only on Windows. UNIX 
          (Linux in particular) supports NTFS, but it will not be a common 
          scenario for someone to configure a NTFS file system to store MySQL 
          data on Linux.
          
          Changes in file bug11761752-master.opt are needed due to 
          bug number 15937938.

  Bug#14775893: MASTER_POS_WAIT CAN HANG WHEN USING GTIDS
  Bug#15927032: SEMI SYNC REPLICATION BREAKS WITH CHANGE
                MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1
  
   When transactions are skipped in a GTID protocol, the
   coordinates of the binary log (on the master) are not
   updated properly by the Slave IO (mi) and Slave SQL (rli)
   threads. This can have several consequences. For example,
   master_pos_wait() depends on the coordinates of the SQL thread, 
   and the function can hang forever or return -1 due to
   improper updation of rli. Other example is, during semi sync
   replication, the master receives an ACK with wrong coordinates
   by slave IO which will break semi sync repl.
  
   This patch corrects the coordinates of the slave by sending
   a heart beat event which carries the coordinates of the last
   skipped transaction during a gtid protocol. This event when 
   received by the IO thread, is put in to the relay log as an 
   ignored Rotate Event. The Rotate Event is read by the slave SQL
   thread to update rli. 
  
   Thereby, this patch solves following  problems
   0) Fixes the *holes* in event coordianates of mi and rli
   1) master_pos_wait() returns values >=0
   2) Fixes the problems in semi sync when using with GTIDs

            On other platforms the default value 196608 for 32 bit machines

  Bug#15980626 POSSIBLE REPLICATION PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION
               THROUGH RLI->FLUSH_INFO(TRUE)
  
  Problem:sync_relay_log_info was being ignored when transactional
  tables were updated. No matter what number was set, relay log info
  file was synced upon committing. This was causing the performance
  degradation.
  
  Fix: Sync(or update relay log info table) after each transaction
  should happen only when both data and relay log info are stored
  in transactional tables. Only this scenario will guarantee crash
  safety.

  Bug#13897507 - EXPLAIN DOES NOT LIST SUBQUERIES IN EXECUTION ORDER
  this patch does not change the order of subqueries in EXPLAIN
  (too difficult to do it now).
  The execution order of subqueries (which subquery is executed
  first, etc.) can be determined by looking at "attached_condition"
  of the table to which this subquery is attached, in the output of
  EXPLAIN FORMAT =JSON. Because this condition is long to read, and
  there can be many '()', this patch adds, to any subquery printed
  in the condition, the number of this subquery (select#) (as is
  already the case in the warning of EXPLAIN EXTENDED and EXPLAIN
  FORMAT= JSON, and in the Optimizer trace). This number can then
  be matched with numbers of query_block's of subqueries.
  At line 813 of explain_json_none.result we can see that this
  numbering helps finding what subquery is executed first.

  Bug#4789249 - LOCKING ASSERT IN FK UPDATE CASCADE CODE, LOCK->TRX->LOCK.WAIT_LOCK == LOCK
  Bug#14707091 SEGV IN LOCK_DEADLOCK_LOCK_PRINT(), NULL LOCK PTR
  
  Joining T1 does a deadlock check due to wait 
  
  T1 is selected as victim (but not rolled back), for any number of reasons.
  
  We try and resolve more deadlocks 
    - T2 is selected as a victim and rolled back 
    - This grants T1 the lock and is no longer the victim.
  
  Since T1 was originally selected as a victim, when we go to reset its lock
  state we trip over the invariant that it must still be in the wait state. 
  
  Fix is to check if T1 was granted a lock when T2 was rolled back during
  additional deadlock checking.

  BUG#15968413 - IMPROVE GTID_SET::IS_INTERSECTION AND GTID_SET::INTERSECTION PERFORMANCE
  Problem:
  1. Gtid_set::is_intersection and Gtid_set::intersection were too
  slow, because they iterated over all GTIDs instead of over all
  intervals. So calling one of the functions on a Gtid_set with
  a single, very big interval like 1-1000000000000 would take too
  long time.
  2. Gtid_set::is_subset had a bug: if this and super had different
  sid_maps, there was a missing bounds check on super's sidno. This
  could cause read from invalid memory and dereferencing uninitialized
  pointer if super had fewer sidnos allocated than super's sid_map,
  and this contains a sidno that super does not contain.
  Fix:
  1. Iterate over intervals, not over GTIDs.
  2. Move the bounds check so it's checked every time.
  Also:
  - Rename is_intersection to is_intersection_nonempty.
  - Refactor and document is_subset, just for clarity.
  - Simplify loops in is_subset.

  Bug#14494893 : INNODB_FILE_PER_TABLE DOES NOT PERMIT ON/OFF AT STARTUP
  
  Details :
   - During server initialization, when boolean values 1/true OR 0/false
     are given, then they were accpected but if on/off were given then
     they were being considered wrong.
  
  Reason :
   - During server initialization, while checking for the valid values
     for boolean parameters, only 1/true AND 0/false were being checked.
  
  Solution :
   - Added code to check for On/Off and if found, make them valid values.
  
   Test case innodb_file_per_table_basic.test is already there to check
   this parameter. So no new test case required. I just added
   --innodb_file_per_table in master.opt files with value On (Default) 
   so that at startup this fix could be verified.
